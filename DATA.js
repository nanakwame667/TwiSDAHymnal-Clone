Join ye in glad adoration!

2.Praise to the Lord, Who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth, Shieldeth thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth! Hast thou not seen how thy desires e'er have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

3.Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee; Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do, If with His love He befriend thee.

O burning sun with golden beam And silver moon with softer gleam:

Refrain
Oh, praise Him! Oh, praise Him! Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

2. O rushing wind and breezes soft, O clouds that ride the winds aloft: Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
O rising morn, in praise rejoice, O lights of evening, find a voice.

3. 0 flowing waters, pure and clear, Make music for your Lord to hear. Oh praise Him! Alleluia!
O fire so masterful and bright, Providing us with warmth and light.

4. Let all things their Creator bless,
And worship him in humbleness, O praise him Alleluia!
Oh, praise the Father, praise the Son, And praise the Spirit, three in One!
